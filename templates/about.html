After several years of fighting crime in the greater Midwest area, Josh retired to a quiet life as a cadet at West Point, where he currently double majors in Computer Science and Anime Studies, where he regrets the former and wholeheartedly enjoys the latter.

		<div style="width:500px; display:inline-block;"><b>Matthew Kim</b> was born in San Francisco, California. Looking at Matt today, you would have never guessed that he felt no sense of purpose in life at one point in time. However, at the tender age of 15, Matt was able to find his passion in e-Sports. Matt was able to pave his way up the ranks in the online game <i>Runescape</i> where he eventually found a spot as one of the top 10 players in the entire world. Matt was recruited to West Point to be the team captain for <i>Runescape's</i> inaugural season at the Academy. However, Matt struggled to balance his role of team captain of the <i>Runescape</i> team and as member of the water polo team since the <i>Runescape</i> team required a body fat percentage over 25%. Eventually, Matt was kicked off the team after he was found hacking other players' accounts for gold. Luckily, Matt was never honor boarded but instead was welcomed with open arms into the EECS department after demonstrating his potential as a computer scientist. Branching aviation, Matt wishes to fly pterodactyls in the future for the Army.</div>

		<div style="width:500px; display:inline-block;"><b>Tyler Reece</b> was born in El Paso, Texas, but as an Army brat, he has moved 27 times all around the world. When Tyler was 8, he suffered a life-threatening head injury while solving a Rubik's cube. Luckily, doctors were able to perform a risky surgery using cutting-edge technology that to save his life but would change Tyler forever. Tyler was never the smartest kid growing up, but following the surgery, Tyler has grown to be the robotic genius that he is today. It is believed that Tyler 'sleeps' at 9:30pm every day to recharge the batteries implanted in his brain by the morning. Tyler is able to run marathons due being part machine, but he chooses to not run the fastest times in order to not draw too much attention himself. An interesting fact about Tyler that is not well-known is that he is 1/4  Korean, but it is unclear how much of that is attributed to the technology in his head.</div>
